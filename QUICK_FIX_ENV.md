# ✅ .env File Created!

The `.env` file has been created successfully in your project root.

## 🔄 Next Step: Restart Your Dev Server

**IMPORTANT**: Vite only reads `.env` files when the server starts, so you must restart:

1. **Stop your current dev server** (press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Start it again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **The error should now be gone!** ✅

## 📋 What Was Created

The `.env` file contains:
- ✅ All Firebase configuration variables
- ✅ Admin credentials
- ✅ All required `VITE_*` prefixed variables

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

After restarting, you should see:
- ✅ No more "Missing Firebase configuration" error
- ✅ App loads normally
- ✅ Firebase connection works

## 🚨 If You Still See Errors

1. Make sure you **restarted the dev server** (this is critical!)
2. Check that the `.env` file exists in the root directory
3. Verify the file has no syntax errors (no extra quotes, spaces around `=`, etc.)

---

**The app should now work correctly!** 🎉
